-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_prank_ideas
--   prank_id: INTEGER
--   target_name: VARCHAR
--   prank_description: VARCHAR
--   evilness_score: INTEGER
--   created_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT target_name, prank_description FROM
  (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY target_name ORDER BY evilness_score DESC, created_at DESC) AS rank
FROM grinch_prank_ideas)
WHERE rank = 1;
