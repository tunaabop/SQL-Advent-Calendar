-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT resort_id, resort_name, total_snowfall, NTILE(4) OVER (order by total_snowfall desc) AS snowfall_quartile
  FROM(SELECT resort_id, resort_name, sum(snowfall_inches) AS total_snowfall
  FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
  GROUP BY resort_id, resort_name) AS annual_snow
  
ORDER BY snowfall_quartile;
